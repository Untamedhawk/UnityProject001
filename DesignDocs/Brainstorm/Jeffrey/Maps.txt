What are some entities that a map will contain?

Tall grass
- Tall enough that a seeker standing still will be almost impossible to see unless standing nearby
- moves slightly when a seeker is moving through it
- potental synergy with certain seeker abilities (clone that ocasionally disturbs the grass to fake the appearence of a seeker)

Tunnels
- Around the external parts of the map far from objectives that allow seekers to reposition themselves without the guardian being able to camp spawn points

Rally Auras
- Objectives capturable that give small global advantages to whoever owns them.

Gateways
- Guardians have the ability to lock a percentage of gateways at any one time
- Example: 5 possible attack directions on the map, guardian capable of visiting and locking any two at any one time
- Requires a very long time to breach, while giving guardian a notification that someone is attempting to break a gateway

Special terrain interactions
- Example: 
	Sand always leaving visible footprints for 30ish seconds
	metal making loud noise hearable by all nearby
	marsh slowing movespeed

Special scene interactions
- Example:
	Seekers that make contact with a thornbush leaves a piece of cloth on it that the guardian would be alerted to in some way with some sort of indicator of how long ago it was
