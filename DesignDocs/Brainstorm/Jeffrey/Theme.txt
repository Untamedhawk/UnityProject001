Possible theme ideas


General fantasy:
Guardian is a kind of mystical creature guarding magical essence (crystals?), while seekers are arcanists of some kind seeking to steal the essence
Pros:
- Allows basically any form of map to fit the style (caverns, forests, mountains, ruins, valleys)
- Generally easy to create assets for and fit a general art style
- Easy to fill in any type of ability (teleportation, magic, melee/range combat)
- Very open in terms of acceptable atmospheric style/music style
- Gives lots of space for suspended realism
Cons:
- Potentially cliche
- Locks out firearms


Steampunk/Robotech:
Guardian is a large contraption protecting critical components, while salvagers attempt to steal them
Pros: 
- Awesome
Cons:
- Difficult to make look convincing
- Thematically strict
- Restricts abilities to something that would fit
- Artistically demanding


General Sci-Fi
Guardian is some form of guardian (duh), while treasure hunters attempt to steal from him
Pros:
- Gives a lot of artistic freedom to do whatever it is we want to do.
- Complete freedom over map development, if we can think of it, it exists
Cons:
- Harder to wrap everything together into a convincing setting, especially without a lot of exposition
- Potentially boring
