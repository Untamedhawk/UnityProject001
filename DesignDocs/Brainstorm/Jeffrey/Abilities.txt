Ability slots:
Problem: seekers have potential to stack abilities of same type to completely outclass guardian in a certain aspect
- Example:
	All three seekers take all mobility abilities, rendering them basically impossible to catch, especially if guardian didn't focus much on mobility
	All three seekers take all utility abilities, allowing them to potentially perma-cc the guardian, which would really suck for the guardian.

Potential solutions:

1:
Each ability has an affinity of some kind. all abilities that affect speed can have a yellow tag, all abilities that affect teleportation/transportation could have a blue tag, etc.
At the beginning of the round the seekers choose a weapon that has a fixed number of slots for abilities,
- Example: 
	Given the following slots:
	- yellow: Mobility
	- blue: Teleportation/Displacement
	- red: Damage/CC
	- green: Utility
	- white: Any of the above
	- purple: Ultimate
	- black: Any of the above

	5 items to choose from. 
		Staff of Mobility: (lots of movement, little else)
			Slot1: yellow
			Slot2: yellow
			Slot3: green/red/blue
			Slot4: black
		Explosive Wand:	(lots of damage, little movement)
			Slot1: red
			Slot2: red/green
			Slot3: white
			Slot4: purple
		Mysterious Stick: (less slots, lots of versatility)
			Slot1: white
			Slot2: white
			Slot3: white
		Obsidian Stone: (potential of two ultimate in exchange for little else)
			Slot1: green
			Slot2: purple
			Slot3: black
		Stone Sceptre: (no ultimate in exchange for 5 slots)
			Slot1: yellow
			Slot2: blue
			Slot3: red
			Slot4: green
			Slot5: white

Given a situation above, where seekers are unable to select duplicate items, they would be far less able to min-max and overpower the guardian via a specific set of cheese. 
It's fully possible to have a similar item set for the guardian, and item selection/ability selection could work in a draft-pick/blind-pick format as well.
